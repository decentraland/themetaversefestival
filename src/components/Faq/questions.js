        question: 'What is Decentraland?',
        answer: () => <p>Launched in 2020, Decentraland is a virtual social world, the first decentralized metaverse, and the only one that is open source. Within the Decentraland platform, which can run on a browser or desktop client, users can create, experience, and monetize content and applications as well as socialize and attend a wide range of daily, community-driven events. Decentraland is unique in that it is owned, created, and governed by the people who use it every day. Through Decentraland’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) users can submit proposals and even apply for grants for the community to vote on.</p>

        answer: () => <p>You don’t need a crypto wallet to attend the festival, or to enter Decentraland for that matter. You can enter as a guest without creating an account. However, if you would like to collect free Wearables as well as further customize your avatar’s look and moves with community-made Wearables and Emotes from the <a href="https://market.decentraland.org/DCLMF23?assetType=item&section=wearables&vendor=decentraland&page=1&sortBy=recently_listed&onlyOnSale=true" target="_blank">Marketplace</a> (and in general save your avatar for return visits to Decentraland) you should sign up for a crypto wallet. Getting a crypto wallet is a simple process and you don’t need to enter any payment details if you just want to save your avatar and claim freebies. Learn more about getting a crypto wallet <a href="https://docs.decentraland.org/player/blockchain-integration/get-a-wallet/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
